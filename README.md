# LongCount
These are a couple of scripts to convert dates between the Gregorian calendar to Mayan Calendar. The Mayan Calendar is presented in a summarized format (diary format) and a detailed break down of the long count. Please feel free to revise the code, contribute, and share.
In the last commit a few functions were updated: (1) Now the base for Haab' is zero. (2) the script uses the long count as the base for time keeping. (3) The input accepts long count or gregorian formats. (4) It accepts negative Bak'tun numbers and hadles special cases.
